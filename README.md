## Introduction

FEEDIE (pronounced `/ˈfi:di/`, combination of **feed** and **foodie**) is a feeding robot specially designed for people who couldn't eat independently. According to our survey, over 20% of the families around us have at least one person who couldn't take care of himself. In these families, about 18% of them think highly of a feeding robot while over 60% of them would still wait and see, who can be regard as potential customers.
